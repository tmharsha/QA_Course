To take notes usign readme markup

I will be using this repository to create notes and as I learn The QA course. FreeCodeCamp being the main resouces, I'll also be drawing information from many other sources. Another one of my intentions is to get a rapport with creating markup docs since I have espceially been intrested in using LaTeX instead of word processors.

This will be a personal repository.

I'll also probably be adding some codes and even host a website in the future as test run and also for fun!
